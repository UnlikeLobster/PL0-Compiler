# PL0-Compiler
A PL/0 compiler driver created for my Systems Software class.

This project was created back in the summer of 2012. For posterity purposes the following files haven't been updated since the project was submitted for grading.

There are PDFs within that detail the requirements of the project at each of its four stages of development. These also detail the ISA used by the compiler driver. The folder "indiv" contains the separate modules of the driver (as submitted) before they were combined into the complete driver. There are also samples of the basic input (input.txt) and its corresponding output (output.txt), listing the table of scanned lexemes, the generated intermediate code, and a printout of the VM's stack trace.

I really enjoyed working on this project and was proud to have completed this challenge individually. Given some free time I may return to this project in the future, creating a new branch to show how to fix the extant bugs, streamline the code, and add features - procedure calling, for instance - that I was unsuccessful in implementing at the time.
